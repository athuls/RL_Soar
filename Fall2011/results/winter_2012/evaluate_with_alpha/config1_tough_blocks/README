0) Change in environment configuration from : 
0 0 9 0.1 0.9 TO 0 0 7 0.1 0.9 

alphaMax=0.9;
alphaMin=0.05;
alphaSteps=30;

epsilonMax=0.5;
epsilonMin=0.01;
epsilonStep=30;

NOTE : the first 1 above suggests a mines world
and the first config file has cumulative rewards corresponding to first environment configuration and second one corresponds to changed configuration

2) We have one independent variable (Algorithm parameters) with more than 2 levels (one level for every pair of learning and exploration rates), along with one dependent variable (cumulative reward, because it depends on the algorithm parameters)
NOTE : we actually have 2 independent variables i.e. learning and exploration rates
